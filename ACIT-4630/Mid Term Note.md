## 1. Attack & Threat Frameworks

### CIA Triad (The Goals)

When an attack happens, identify what was lost:

- **Confidentiality:** Data was seen by someone who shouldn't have. (_Ex: A data breach/sniffing_).
    
- **Integrity:** Data was changed or modified. (_Ex: An attacker changes a bank balance_).
    
- **Availability:** The system is down or slow. (_Ex: A DDoS attack_).
    

### STRIDE (The Threats)

|Threat|Violation|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**S**poofing|**Authentication**|Faking an identity (IP spoofing, email spoofing).|
|**T**ampering|**Integrity**|Modifying a file or a packet in transit.|
|**R**epudiation|**Non-repudiation**|Denying you sent a message because there are no logs.|
|**I**nformation Disclosure|**Confidentiality**|Leaking private database records.|
|**D**enial of Service|**Availability**|Crashing a website so legitimate users can't enter.|
|**E**levation of Privilege|**Authorization**|A standard user gaining Admin/Root access.|

## 2. Hacker Profiles & Skills

- **White Hat:** Ethical/Legal (Pentesters).
    
- **Black Hat:** Malicious/Illegal (Criminals).
    
- **Gray Hat:** Hacks without permission but usually without "malice" (e.g., to find a bug).
    
- **Hacktivist:** Hacks for a political or social cause (e.g., Anonymous).
    
- **Script Kiddie:** Uses pre-made tools; doesn't understand the code.
    
- **State-Sponsored:** Highly funded by a government (APT - Advanced Persistent Threat).
    

**The Labels:**

- **Red Team:** Offensive (The Attackers).
    
- **Blue Team:** Defensive (The Defenders/Detection).

## 3. Vulnerabilities & Acronyms

- **Zero-Day:** A vulnerability exploited **before** a patch is available.
    
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures):** A list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity bugs (The ID number).
    
- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):** The **category** of the flaw (e.g., "Buffer Overflow").
    
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** The **score** (0-10) of how dangerous it is.
    
- **Sources of Vulnerabilities:** 1. **Software Bugs** (bad code) 2. **Misconfigurations** (weak passwords/open ports).

## 4. Malware & Botnets

- **Worm:** Spreads **automatically** across a network (no human help).
    
- **Trojan:** Disguised as something useful (e.g., a "free" game).
    
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts your data for money.
    
- **Rootkit:** Hides at the **Kernel level** (deep OS) to avoid detection.
    

**Botnets:**

- **Components:** **Botmaster** (Attacker), **Command & Control (C&C)** server, and **Zombies/Bots** (Infected devices).
    
- **How they work:** The Botmaster sends a command to the C&C, which pushes the order to thousands of Zombies to launch a DDoS attack.

## 5. Social Engineering Factors

- **Authority:** "I'm the IT Director, give me your password."
    
- **Urgency:** "Your account will be deleted in 5 minutes!"
    
- **Scarcity:** "Only 3 reset links left today."
    
- **Trust/Liking:** Building a friendly rapport before asking for a favor.

## 6. Backups & Operations

**The 3-Circle Diagram:** The struggle between **Security**, **Functionality**, and **Ease of Use**. If you increase one, the others typically suffer.

**Backup Strategies:**

- **Full:** Everything. **Fastest Restore** (only 1 file needed). **Slowest Backup**.
    
- **Incremental:** Changes since _any_ last backup. **Fastest Backup**. **Slowest Restore** (Needs Full + every increment).
    
- **Differential:** Changes since the last _Full_. Medium speed for both.

## 7. Cryptography & PKI

### Comparison Table

|Feature|Symmetric|Asymmetric|
|---|---|---|
|**Keys**|**1 Key** (Shared Secret)|**2 Keys** (Public & Private)|
|**Speed**|**Very Fast**|**Slow**|
|**Use Case**|Bulk data / Hard drives|Key Exchange / Digital Signatures|
|**Algos**|**AES**, DES, 3DES|**RSA**, ECC, Diffie-Hellman|

### Digital Signatures (The Opposite Logic)

- **Encryption:** I use **YOUR Public Key** (Only you can open it).
    
- **Signature:** I use **MY Private Key** (Everyone uses my Public Key to verify it's really me).
    

**Hashing:** One-way math. Used for Integrity.

- **Algorithms:** **SHA-256**, MD5 (weak), SHA-1 (weak).
    

### PKI & Certificates

- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):** The framework that manages trust.
    
- **Server Certificate Attributes (Lab 6):** Common Name (the domain), Organization, Country, and the **Public Key**.
    
- **Verification:** Your browser uses the **CA's Public Key** to decrypt the signature on the **Server Certificate**.
    
- **Revocation:** **CRL** (a list) or **OCSP** (a real-time status check).
    
- **Self-Signed:** Recognized if the **Issuer** and the **Subject** are the same name.
